# Just One More MS4

Just one more is a e-commerce site for lovers of gaming, music and tech.

# User Experience (UX)

The front page is simply and not to cluttered, this is so the user is not overwhelmed with things to look at as this can create a poor user experience. Users
are free to look around as they please and navigate their way round easily. Red is used for the important parts of the page, like checkout and add to basket buttons
and also used in heading to indicate very clearly what page you are. This styling has been kept consistent through out the site and is easy to follow. The Only exception to
this rule is the quantity button in the bag page, where the update button is green and the remove button is red. The reason for this is because you would traditionally 
associate green as a complete or proceed indicator and red as a delete indicator. Overall the UX is clean and easy to follow

# Scope

### Overview
This site is designed around my own interests in music and video games. I want the website to a one stop shop for all products related to gaming and music. I wanted it have
a simple and clean design so it is not too overwhelming for the user and not so in your face. It meant to be inviting and harkens back to my first project by adopting,
Minimal Viable Product, the advantage of this for new users of the site is, it is easy to understand and conveys a message effectively but simply. My Skill-set has raised
since my first project however and I have added a lot of back-end trickery that the front-end user shouldn't notice while still keeping the site as a whole clean.
