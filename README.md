## Scope

### Overview
This site is designed around my own interests in music and video games. I want the website to a one stop shop for all products related to gaming and music. I wanted it have
a simple and clean design so it is not too overwhelming for the user and not so in your face. It meant to be inviting and harkens back to my first project by adopting,
Minimal Viable Product, the advantage of this for new users of the site is, it is easy to understand and conveys a message effectively but simply. My Skill-set has raised
since my first project however and I have added a lot of back-end trickery that the front-end user shouldn't notice while still keeping the site as a whole clean.

# Database

During the development of the site I used SQLite3
Once deployed it was changed over to PostgresSQL which is provided by heroku

The database is from multiple apps and has models relevant to what is needed for things like, users, products and reviews.
These are my database tables and my Database ER Diagram

# Testing

## Navigation Bar

### Just One More

- When I click the name of the page, Just one More, it takes you to the home page regardless of which page I am. This work on all devices

### Navigation Buttons 

- There are a few navigation links that consist of the types of products that are avalible on the page. These links all have dropdowns which will allow the user to sort
the products into price, rating, platform etc.. For the Super User I have also added the ability to see all products at once. The reason I have done this is because
the vast majority of e-commerce sites don't have this option due to the vast quantity of products. Though my site is small I didn't want to treat as though it was a small site but rather an expanding one which I can hundreds or thousands of products too.

### Search

- The search is present all the time during desktop versions of the site and is hidden away in the offcanvas nav bar. The search bar allows to search for products. When you type a word in to the search bar, as long as it is the description of the product or title of the product. It will return those products to the screen for the user to see. If you type something in that doesn't appear in the parameters mentions then it will return a message to say "No Product Found" and redirect you to the products page.

## Products

### Products Page

- The overall product pages don't do much apart from display the products avalible to the customer. This does need to be linked to the database attached with django or postgres which worked flawlessly.

### Product Detail Page

- The Product detail is much the same as the product page apart from displaying all of the products it will only show the one you clicked on.

### Add to basket

- Any users of the website can add items to the bag. In addition to this you can also specify quantity of the items and size of the product, if this option have been avalible to said product

### Add Product

- The Super user has the ability to add products by clicking the product management button. This is linked to the add_product function in the views. This works perfectly and once the product has been added it will redirect to the product which the super user has made. There are few requirements for the add product but because the page is meant to be used for many different types of products.

### Edit Product

- Once again the edit_product function is only accessible to the super user. This form can be accessed through a specific products page, so for example if i want to edit God of War:Ragnarok then I have to click into said page. Once in the super user will be presented with the edit product button which will redirect him to a form very similar to the add_product form. The fields will be pre-filled and you can just edit the applicable fields. Once complete you will be returned to said products page

### Remove Product

- Again only accessible to the super user. The delete button is also avalible through the specific product page. You will be able to see the delete product button which will instantly delete the product you are in and return you to the products page. I would like to at some point add a modal so that the user can be prompted to this action before committing.

### Reviews

- Any signed in user has the ability to add a review for the product they are in. This will displayed the bottom of the specific page they are on and only requires to fields, User Review and Rating. Once the review has been written it will display on the product items page with the review, rating and created_by tags. I would like to add the delete review function at some point but for now I just wanted to get it working.

## Bag

### Basket 

- The basket button is live and any product that is added to the bag will then display the product price in basket icon in the bottom right of the screen. The user will also be prompted with a message confirming the product added to the basket.

### Bag

- The bag is accessible only once you have an item in your bag. The only exception to this is when you remove items from the bag it will display a message saying the bag is empty and will prompt the user to go back to the products page. If you do have products in the bag you will be able to see which products you have added, in addition to this depending on the type of product you have added it will display specific details which are applicable to that product, like sizes, quantity and platform.

## Checkout 

### Checkout form

- The form is generated through `forms.py` and displayed to the user via `crispy_forms`. The fields that are displayed are as follows.

1. Full Name
2. Email
3. Mobile Number
4. First Address Line
5. Second Address Line
6. Town or City
7. County
8. Postcode
9. Country
10. Stripe Payment Form

### Stripe Payments

- The payment system is handled through Stripe. Stripe enables me to test the function of the checkout form by using "4242 4242 4242 4242" Card number. This send a test to the stripe server side and generate a "successful" payment. You can also use other forms of testing like "4000 0027 6000 3184" which make authorize the payment manually before it submits

### Email Confirmation

- Once a successful payment has been processed you will recieve an email which will have details of the order, like order number, product name etc.... 

## Profile

### Registration

- If you are not signed in you will have the option to register an account. Once you click register account you will be redirected to the registration screen where you will be prompted to fill out the form. This form does have built in security features built in which is from `django-all_auth`. Such features are, min and max length of username and password and password similarity. Once you have been filled the form out the user will be sent an email with a confirmation link. Once that link has been clicked you will asked to confirm which finishes the registration process

### Sign in

- If you have registered you will be given the option to sign in. The credentials from your previous registration are all saved, so all you have to do is hit sign in and login with the details given. You can also request for the form to remember you, this should only be used on a private machine however.

### Profile 

- Once you have an account you will have access to more features, like saving delivery details and being able to leave a user review. You can also update your details through the account page. If you have placed any order you will also see your previous orders, these can be clicked into allowing you to review your orders without searching through emails.

## Summary

Every single feature has been tested and works as expected.

# Deployment 

### To Clone 

* The project can be run locally by cloning.
* Open the repository and click "Code", then select "clone".
* When you choose to clone you will be provided with a URL. Copy the URL from the "Clone with HTTPS" section.
* In your IDE, open Git Bash.
* Type Git Clone and then paste the URL you copied.
* Press enter and this will create the clone.

**Requirements**
* Python3
* GitHub account
* Heroku account
* Gitpod or an IDE of your choice
* Stripe account
* AWS Amazon account
* Gmail account

### Work With The Local Copy

* Ensure you have all of the above requirements set up.
* Go to the workspace of your local copy. In the CLI type: <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>
* Set up the environment variables: 
    - Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the project. 
    - Create a `.env.py` file. To this add the following environmental variables.

    ```
    Import os
    os.environ("SECRET_KEY_MS4", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("DATABASE_URL", "Added by developer")
    ```
    - As an alternative to storing these enviromental variables in env.py, if you are working with Gitpod these can be stored in account settings accessed by visiting your workspaces. Click the profile icon, add the variables here and then correctly reference these within settings.
* Add the env.py file to gitignore.
* Next perform migrations to create the database. Do this by running the command <code>python3 manage.py makemigrations</code> followed by <code>python3 manage.py migrate</code>
* Create a superuser to have access to the admin panel. <code>python3 manage.py createsuperuser</code>
* Now run the app locally using <code>python3 manage.py runserver</code>

### Heroku Deployment 

* To deploy to Heroku, log in or sign up and create a new app.
* Complete the information regarding location and app name.
* Once this is done, go to resources and search for postgres and add this to your app.
* In your CLI install dj_database_url and psycopg2 so that you can use Postgres on your deployed site, install these using the following 
  <code>pip3 install dj_database_url
  pip3 install psycopg2</code>
* Log in using the CLI <code>heroku login -i</code>
* Migrate the database to postgres using <code>heroku run python manage.py migrate</code>
* Install gunicorn using <code>pip3 install gunicorn</code>
* Create a file called Procfile and ensure this is in it: 
```
web: gunicorn name_of_application.wsgi:application
```
* In settings set allowed hosts using 
```
 ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
* In Heroku, select the deploy tab and under deployment method choose GitHub
* In connect to GitHub enter your GitHub repository details and when you see the correct one click connect.
* Go to the Settings tab and under Config Vars choose Reveal Config Vars, then enter the following config vars:


    | KEY            | VALUE         |
    |----------------|---------------|
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<aws access key>`  |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<aws secret access key>`  |
    | DATABASE_URL| `<postgres database url>`  |
    | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
    | EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<email address>`  |
    | SECRET_KEY_MS4 | `<your secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
    | USE_AWS | `True`  |

* Set up Database
    - Copy the **DATABASE_URL** (Postgres URL) from the config variables of Heroku and paste it into the default database in `settings.py`.

    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<DATABASE_URL here>")
    }

  This setup for the databases is only temporary while deploying to Heroku.
  - Migrate the models to create the database by the following commands:
        - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
        - `python3 manage.py migrate`
  - Load the data fixtures for categories and product in this exact order:
      - `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
      - `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
  - Create a superuser. The superuser will have access to the admin page.
    - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Enter your username, email and password.
    - Remove the DATABASE_URL from `settings.py` and set the previous default DATABASE settings.
    - Push the code to Github.

#### Static & Media Files
* To host static and media files you will need an AWS S3 Bucket. 
  - You will need to create an account and create an S3 bucket. From here set up a group, a policy and user in the IAM environment. 
  - For further detail on these parameters and a deeper explanation you can find out more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

# Credits
